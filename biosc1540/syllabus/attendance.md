    Attending classes virtually (i.e., over Zoom) will not be an option.

If you cannot attend a class, it remains vital for you to engage with the materials covered during that session.
You will be responsible for covering the content on your own time, but you should come to any office hours and ask questions.
This practice ensures you maintain a strong connection with the course material and its overarching learning objectives, even when your physical presence is impossible.
