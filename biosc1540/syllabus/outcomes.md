# Outcomes

Course outcomes are crucial in higher education, providing a clear roadmap for instructors and students.
They define the knowledge and skills students are expected to gain, guide the structure of the course, and inform assessments.
The outcomes also facilitate constructive feedback, promote continuous improvement, and communicate the course's value to various stakeholders.
Additionally, they align with institutional goals, support students' professional development, and ensure that the course contributes meaningfully to broader educational objectives.

The following outcomes guide my design and implementation of this course.

1.  Develop a strong foundation in computational biology concepts and methodologies.
2.  Acquire practical data analysis, modeling, and interpretation skills using Python.
3.  Understand genomic and transcriptomic analysis techniques and their applications.
4.  Explore the principles and techniques of computer-aided drug design.
5.  Gain hands-on experience in molecular simulations and structural analysis.
6.  Evaluate and apply computational methods to solve real-world biological problems.
7.  Prepare students for further research or applications in computational biology and related fields.
