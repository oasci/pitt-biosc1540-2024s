# Philosophy

The Computational Biology course explores how to gain insight into biological phenomena with computational methodologies.
Below is the course philosophy that drives my teaching.

## Single source of truth

Each course should have a single source of truth (SSOT), which is having a single authoritative source of data and information across the course.
Having an SSOT can help you access all the information related to the course in one place.
SSOT can help reduce confusion and ensure everyone is on the same page.
For this course, the SSOT is [pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org](https://pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org/).

Another benefit of having an SSOT website is that it can help keep the course content up-to-date and accurate.
Your instructor can change the website as needed; you will always have access to the most current information.
This can help ensure you learn the most relevant and up-to-date material.
Finally, having an SSOT website can help improve communication between your instructor and the students.
Your instructor can share important announcements, assignments, and other course-related information on the website.
This can help ensure everyone is informed and up-to-date on what's happening in the course.

## Everything is a draft

Open science is one of my core values and extends to my teaching.
You will likely see me working on things that will be assigned in an hour or next week.
Teaching new courses or making significant changes always works like this.
Thus, looking ahead is acceptable, and all drafts are marked with the following admonition.
If you start working ahead and things change, your time is lost.

!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

I will do my best to avoid mistakes, but they can happen.
If you see grammar or spelling issues or need clarification on passages that don't have the DRAFT admonition, feel free to tell me about it so I can correct it.

## Computational biology is highly interdisciplinary

Computational biology lies at the intersection of biology, computer science, and machine learning to analyze intricate biological data, model biological processes, and make predictive contributions to life sciences.
Data often involves genetic sequencing, host-pathogen interactions, and protein dynamics and modulation; thus, computational biologists require a deep understanding of biology.
The intersection with computer science is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and tools, employing programming languages and software engineering principles.
Machine learning also plays a key role.
Some of the most significant computational biology advancements are from machine learning, and it is essential to grasp these principles to stay at the forefront of computational biology research.

## Broad sampling of major fields

By making this course a sampling of significant fields of computational biology, you will gain a broad understanding of what is possible.
Additionally, by exposing you to various topics, I am helping you develop diverse skills that will be useful in many different career paths.
Computational biology is a rapidly evolving field, and by providing you with a broad foundation, I am preparing you to adapt to new challenges and opportunities as they arise.

## Real-world scenarios enhance learning

As we delve into computational biology, I want to emphasize the practical relevance of each module.
Instead of a traditional approach, we'll be driven by motivating real-world scenarios that underscore the importance of the concepts you'll be learning. Consider yourself a problem solver in a scientific expedition, applying computational tools to tackle actual challenges faced in the field.
From predicting the impact of genetic variations on disease susceptibility to simulating the dynamics of biological systems under different conditions, our focus will be tangible applications.
This approach ensures that what you learn in this course is not confined to theoretical frameworks but has direct implications for understanding and addressing complex biological phenomena.

## Connecting you to opportunities

Embarking on a journey in computational biology is most effectively achieved by actively participating in a research lab at [Pitt](https://www.pitt.edu/).
This hands-on experience enriches your understanding and provides a practical immersion; computational biology research is becoming an expectation to remain competitive in today's job market.
The modules in this course integrate seamlessly with this approach, offering direct links to labs that leverage tools relevant to the specific content covered.
You are encouraged to contact these labs to see if they have paid or for-credit research positions available.
