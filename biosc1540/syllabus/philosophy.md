# Philosophy

This course, Computational Biology, provides a brief exploration of using computational approaches to gain insight into biological phenomena.
Below is my course philosophy that drives my teaching.

## Single source of truth

Each course should have a single source of truth (SSOT), which is having a single authoritative source of data and information across the course.
Having an SSOT can help you access all the information related to the course in one place.
This can help reduce confusion and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
For this course, the SSOT is [pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org](https://pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org/).

Another benefit of having a website as the SSOT is that it can help keep the course content up-to-date and accurate.
Your instructor can make changes to the website as needed, and you will always have access to the most current information.
This can help ensure that you are learning the most relevant and up-to-date material.
Finally, having a website as the SSOT can help improve communication between your instructor and the students.
Your instructor can use the website to share important announcements, assignments, and other course-related information.
This can help ensure that everyone is informed and up-to-date on whatâ€™s happening in the course.

## Everything is a draft

Open science is one of my core values and this also extends to my teaching.
You will likely see me working on things that will be assigned in an hour or next week.
Teaching new courses, or making major changes, always works like this.
Thus, looking ahead is acceptable and all drafts will be marked with the following admonition.
If you start working ahead and then things change, that is your time lost.

!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

I will do my best to avoid mistakes, but they can happen.
If you see grammar or spelling issues or confusing passages that don't have the DRAFT admonition, feel free to tell me about it so I can correct it.

## Computational biology is highly interdisciplinary

Computational biology lies at the intersection of biology, computer science, and machine learning to analyze intricate biological data, model biological processes, and make predictive contributions to life sciences.
Data often involves genetic sequencing, host-pathogen interactions, and protein dynamics and modulation; thus, computational biologists require a deep understanding of biology.
The intersection with computer science is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and tools, employing programming languages and software engineering principles.
Machine learning also plays a key role.
Some of the largest computational biology advancements are from machine learning, and it is essential to grasp these principles to stay at the forefront of computational biology research.

## Broad sampling of major fields

I believe that by making this course a sampling of major fields of computational biology, you will gain a broad understanding of what is possible.
Additionally, by exposing you to a range of topics, I am helping you develop a diverse set of skills that will be useful in many different career paths.
Computational biology is a rapidly evolving field, and by providing you with a broad foundation, I am preparing you to adapt to new challenges and opportunities as they arise.

## Real-world scenarios enhance learning

As we delve into the realm of computational biology, I want to emphasize the practical relevance of each module.
Instead of a traditional approach, we'll be driven by motivating real-world scenarios that underscore the importance of the concepts you'll be learning. Consider yourself a problem solver in a scientific expedition, applying computational tools to tackle actual challenges faced in the field.
From predicting the impact of genetic variations on disease susceptibility to simulating the dynamics of biological systems under different conditions, our focus will be on tangible applications.
This approach ensures that what you learn in this course is not confined to theoretical frameworks but has direct implications for understanding and addressing complex biological phenomena.

## Connecting you to opportunities

Embarking on a journey in computational biology is most effectively achieved by actively participating in a research lab at [Pitt](https://www.pitt.edu/).
This hands-on experience not only enriches your understanding but also provides a practical immersion.
The modules in this course are designed to seamlessly integrate with this approach, offering direct links to labs that leverage tools relevant to the specific content covered.
You are encouraged to reach out to these labs and see if they have paid or for-credit research positions available.
