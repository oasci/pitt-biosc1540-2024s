# Philosophy

This course, Computational Biology, provides a brief exploration of using computational approaches to gain insight into biological phenomena.
Below is my course philosophy that drives my approach in how I teach this course.

## The two branches of computational biology

In my perspective, there are two main branches of computational biology: bioinformatics and computational structural biology.

## Keeping up with rapidly evolving

Computational biology is incredibly interdisciplinary where you need expertise in biology, computer science, mathematics, and machine learning&mdash;some of the most dynamic fields.
As the field navigates these technological frontiers, the course will prepare students with a foundational understanding to engage with the rapid changes in contemporary computational biology.

## Connecting you to opportunities

If you want to pursue computational biology, the best way is to get involved in a research lab at [Pitt](https://www.pitt.edu/).
Each module contains links to labs that uses tools related to that field.
