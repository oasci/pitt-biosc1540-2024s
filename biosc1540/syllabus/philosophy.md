# Philosophy

This course, Computational Biology, provides a brief exploration of using computational approaches to gain insight into biological phenomena.
Below is my course philosophy that drives my approach in how I teach this course.

## Single source of truth

Each course should have a single source of truth (SSOT), which is having a single authoritative source of data and information across the course.
Having a SSOT can help you access all the information related to the course in one place.
This can help reduce confusion and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
**For this course, the SSOT is [pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org](https://pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org/).**

Another benefit of having a website as the SSOT is that it can help keep the course content up-to-date and accurate.
Your instructor can make changes to the website as needed, and you will always have access to the most current information.
This can help ensure that you are learning the most relevant and up-to-date material.
Finally, having a website as the SSOT can help improve communication between your instructor and the students.
Your instructor can use the website to share important announcements, assignments, and other course-related information.
This can help ensure that everyone is informed and up-to-date on whatâ€™s happening in the course.

## The two branches of computational biology

In my perspective, there are two main branches of computational biology: bioinformatics and computational structural biology.

## Keeping up with rapidly evolving fields

Computational biology is incredibly interdisciplinary where you need expertise in biology, computer science, mathematics, and machine learning&mdash;some of the most dynamic fields.
As the field navigates these technological frontiers, the course will prepare students with a foundational understanding to engage with the rapid changes in contemporary computational biology.

## Real-world scenarios enhance learning

## Connecting you to opportunities

If you want to pursue computational biology, the best way is to get involved in a research lab at [Pitt](https://www.pitt.edu/).
Each module contains links to labs that uses tools related to that field.
