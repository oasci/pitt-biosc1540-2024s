# Assessments

The course will be out of **1000** points and letter grades will be assigned based on the [Pitt's recommended scale](#scale).
As the semester progresses, you will be able to clearly see your standing in the course.

## Distribution

-   [**Checkpoints**](../../assessments/checkpoints/) (40% or 400 points)
    -   Genomics (100 points)
    -   Transcriptomics (100 points)
    -   CADD (200 points)
-   [**Assignments**](../../assessments/assignments/) (35% or 350 points)
-   [**Quizzes**](../../assessments/quizzes/) (15% or 150 points)
    -   Genomics (50 points)
    -   Transcriptomics (50 points)
    -   CADD (50 points)
-   [**Participation**](../../assessments/participation/) (10% or 100 points)

## Late assignments and extensions

I am mindful of the diverse nature of deadlines, particularly in the scientific realm.
Some are set in stone, while others exhibit more flexibility.
It is noteworthy that the scientific community frequently submits manuscripts and reviews days, weeks, or months after the editor's request.
Such practices are widely understood.
Conversely, submitting a grant application even a minute past the deadline makes it ineligible for review.

I will use the following late assignment and extension policy.
It encourages timely submissions while acknowledging the influence of external commitments and unforeseen circumstances.

-   Each student will start with **20 extra credit points**.
-   Every assignment comes with **an automatic two-day extension window**.
    No explanation or justification is needed.
-   However, **using this extension will result in a deduction of your extra credit worth 10% of the assignment**.
    For example, if you submit an assignment worth 50 points one day late, your extra credit will be reduced by 5 points.
-   After this extension window, the assignment will not be accepted (i.e., zero points), but no extra credit will be lost.
-   Exceptions for the loss of extra credit will be made on a case-by-case basis.
-   Once your extra credit becomes zero, no late assignments will be **automatically** accepted.

If you submit every assignment on time, the extra credit is worth 2% of your total grade&mdash;equal to a bump to the next highest letter grade if you are close.
Thus, I will not round up any final grades.

## Drop policy

Each student will be allowed to drop one quiz.

## Midterm grades

Midterm grades will be calculated based on the percentage of total possible points at that time.
For example, if there were 500 points possible and you have 465 points then your midterm grade would be a 93.0% or an `A`.
