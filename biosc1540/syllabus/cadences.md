## Lectures

Each lecture is 75 minutes.
As a student, I could never maintain enough focus for more than 30 or so minutes.
This experience has driven me to pursue the following cadence for lectures to minimize mental fatigue.

-   **Introduction (~5 min):** Class announcements and unanswered questions from previous lectures.
    Recap of the previous lecture's core concepts leading into the big picture of the learning objectives
-   **Presentation (~20 min):** Visual presentation covering the core concepts for that lecture.
-   **Activity (~10 min)**: Hands-on activity to apply the covered concepts.
-   **Presentation (~20 min):** Visual presentation delving deeper into the materials.
-   **Activity (~20 min)**: Hands-on activity to cement the material.

Activities need to be submitted by 11:00 am on the same day.
