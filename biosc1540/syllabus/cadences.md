# Cadences

!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work-in-progress and is subject to change at any moment.

In this course, we will be following a structured cadence that is designed to help you achieve your academic goals.
The cadence of the course refers to the rhythm and pace at which we will cover the material.
By following a structured schedule, you will be able to plan your study time more effectively and stay on track with the course material.
It is a carefully crafted schedule that ensures we cover all the topics in a timely manner while giving you enough time to absorb the material.

## Lectures

Each lecture is 75 minutes.
As a student, I could never maintain enough focus for more than 30 or so minutes.
This experience has driven me to pursue the following cadence for lectures to minimize mental fatigue.

-   **Introduction (~5 min):** Class announcements and unanswered questions from previous lectures.
    Recap of previous lecture's core concepts leading into the big picture of the learning objectives
-   **Presentation (~20 min):** Visual presentation covering the core concepts for that lecture.
-   **Activity (~10 min)**: Hands-on activity to apply the covered concepts.
-   **Presentation (~20 min):** Visual presentation delving deeper into the materials.
-   **Activity (~20 min)**: Hands-on activity to cement the material.

Activities need to be submitted by 11:00 am.
