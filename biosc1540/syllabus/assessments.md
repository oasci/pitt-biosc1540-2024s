# Assessments

The course will be out of **1000** points and letter grades will be assigned according the [Pitt's recommended scale](#scale).
As the semester progresses, you will be able to clearly see your standing in the course.

## Late assignments and extensions

!!! danger

    This section is unedited from my BIOSC 1630 course and **will** change for this one.

I am mindful of the diverse nature of deadlines, particularly in the scientific realm.
Some are set in stone, while others exhibit more flexibility.
It is noteworthy that in the scientific community frequently submit manuscripts and reviews days, weeks, or months after the editor's request.
Such practices are widely understood.
Conversely, submitting a grant application even a minute past the deadline makes it ineligible for review.

With this in mind, I will use the following late assignment and extension policy.
It encourages timely submissions while acknowledging the influence of external commitments and unforeseen circumstances.

-   Each student will start with **20 extra credit points**.
-   Every assignment comes with **an automatic two-day extension window**.
    You can submit your assignment for full credit until Friday at 1:00 PM.
    No explanation or justification is needed.
-   However, **using this extension will result in a deduction of your extra credit worth 20% of the assignment**.
    For example, if you submit an assignment worth 10 points one day late, your extra credit will be reduced by 2 points.
-   After this extension window, the assignment will not be accepted (i.e., zero points), but no extra credit would be lost.
-   Exceptions for the loss of extra credit will be made in a similar procedure as the [attendance](../attendance) policy.

If you submit every assignment on time, the extra credit is worth 2% of your total grade&mdash;equal to a bump to the next highest letter grade if you are close.
Thus, I will not round up any final grades if requested.

## Midterm grades

Midterm grades will be calculated based on the percentage of total possible points at that time.
For example, if there were 500 points possible and you have 465 points then your midterm grade would be a 93.0% or an `A`.
