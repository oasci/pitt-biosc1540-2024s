**Date:** Feb 06, 2024

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture.

1.  ðŸ§« Explain the significance of DNA sequence alignment in bioinformatics and its crucial role in genetic analysis.
2.  ðŸ§® Describe different scoring systems for sequence alignment, emphasizing how penalties for insertions, deletions (indels), and substitutions affect alignment outcomes.
3.  ðŸ§® Distinguish between global and local pairwise sequence alignment.
4.  ðŸ§® Explain the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm as a method for global alignment, including its theoretical basis and application.
5.  ðŸ§® Explain the Smith-Waterman algorithm as a method for local alignment, including how it differs from the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and its specific applications.
