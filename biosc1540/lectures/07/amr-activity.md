# Outbreak Investigation Simulation: Mysterious Respiratory Illness

A community is grappling with a mysterious respiratory illness that has already claimed the lives of 10 individuals.
The nature and origin of this illness remain unknown, raising concerns among the public and requiring immediate attention from public health experts.
As participants in this simulation, you are designated as public health experts tasked with conducting a rapid investigation to understand the outbreak, identify potential sources, and develop strategies to track and prevent further infections.

## Origin groups  (4 minutes)

The class will be split into four groups each assigned a possible pathogen origin into this community.

1.  **Environmental Reservoirs:**
    Explore the possibility of the pathogen originating from environmental sources, such as contaminated water, soil, or wildlife habitats.
2.  **Zoonotic Transmission:**
    Investigate the potential for the pathogen to have a zoonotic origin, transmitted from animals to humans.
3.  **Healthcare Settings:**
    Examine the possibility of the pathogen emerging within healthcare settings.
4.  **Human-to-Human Transmission:**
    Explore scenarios where the pathogen could have originated through direct human-to-human transmission.

Within your teams, brainstorm and discuss how potential antibiotic usage within that origin could influence resistance and it's impact on the pathogen evolution.

<!--
Environmental Reservoirs:
    "In agricultural practices, the use of antibiotics in livestock may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains in animals, and these resistant strains could potentially end up in the environment."
    "Contaminated water sources could harbor bacteria exposed to antibiotics, leading to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the pathogen."

Zoonotic Transmission:
    "The use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine might select for antibiotic-resistant strains in animals, increasing the likelihood of zoonotic transmission to humans."
    "Deforestation and habitat destruction may force wildlife into closer contact with human populations, increasing the risk of transmitting antibiotic-resistant pathogens."

Healthcare Settings:
    "Overprescription of antibiotics in healthcare settings can exert selective pressure, promoting the development of antibiotic-resistant strains within hospitals."
    "Poor infection control practices may facilitate the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens within healthcare environments, impacting the evolution of the pathogen."

Human-to-Human Transmission:
    "International travel allows for the rapid spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, creating a global challenge for controlling the evolution of pathogens."
    "In crowded environments, such as airports or urban areas, the close proximity of individuals can enhance the transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, influencing their evolution."

## Transmission (4 minutes)

Given your number from the previous section, discuss your assigned mode of transmission.

1.  **Contaminated Water Sources:**
    -   Explore the hypothesis of the respiratory illness being transmitted through contaminated water sources.
    -   Discuss the potential role of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in waterborne transmission.
    -   Consider how traditional methods of water treatment may be affected by the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains.
2.  **Vector-Borne Transmission:**
    -   Consider the possibility of a vector, such as insects or animals, being involved in transmitting the respiratory illness.
    -   Discuss how antibiotic resistance in these vectors could impact the spread of the pathogen.
    -   Explore the challenges in managing the outbreak when the mode of transmission involves a vector with antibiotic-resistant characteristics.
3.  **Person-to-Person Transmission:**
    -   Investigate the potential for person-to-person transmission within healthcare settings.
    -   Emphasize how antibiotic resistance might complicate the situation, especially in hospitals where patients are more vulnerable.
    -   Discuss the role of healthcare-associated infections and the challenges of managing antibiotic-resistant strains in such environments.
4.  **Airborne Transmission:**
    -   Explore the possibility of the respiratory illness being transmitted through the air.
    -   Discuss how an antibiotic-resistant strain could impact the transmission dynamics and the challenges it poses to traditional treatment methods.
    -   Consider scenarios where the resistance may affect the effectiveness of common antibiotics.

Group 1: Contaminated Water Sources and Antibiotic Resistance:

    Answer: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in water may originate from agricultural runoff containing animal waste treated with antibiotics, leading to contamination of water sources.
    Answer: Discuss the potential for antibiotic-resistant bacteria to enter water bodies through industrial discharges, emphasizing the role of improper disposal practices.
    Answer: Consider the reduced efficacy of traditional water treatment methods like chlorination in eliminating antibiotic-resistant strains, leading to challenges in ensuring safe drinking water.

Group 2: Vector-Borne Transmission with Antibiotic Resistance in Vectors:

    Answer: Investigate the role of mosquitoes or ticks as vectors carrying antibiotic-resistant strains, possibly acquired from feeding on animals treated with antibiotics.
    Answer: Discuss the impact of antibiotic use in veterinary practices on the development of antibiotic resistance in animals, subsequently affecting vectors involved in the outbreak.
    Answer: Explore challenges in vector control strategies, such as insecticides, when dealing with vectors that have developed resistance to commonly used chemicals.

Group 3: Person-to-Person Transmission in Healthcare Settings:

    Answer: Examine the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains in healthcare settings due to overprescription and overuse of antibiotics, leading to nosocomial infections.
    Answer: Discuss how compromised immunity in hospitalized patients, coupled with antibiotic-resistant strains, increases the risk of severe infections and transmission.
    Answer: Explore the role of medical devices and invasive procedures in facilitating the transmission of antibiotic-resistant strains among patients, highlighting the importance of stringent infection control measures.

Group 4: Airborne Transmission:

    Answer: Investigate how crowded living conditions contribute to the airborne transmission of the respiratory illness, with antibiotic resistance influencing the persistence and virulence of the pathogen.
    Answer: Discuss how respiratory procedures, such as intubation or ventilation, may aerosolize antibiotic-resistant strains, increasing the risk of airborne transmission in healthcare settings.
    Answer: Explore scenarios where the airborne transmission poses challenges in implementing traditional infection control measures, especially when dealing with antibiotic-resistant strains that may evade common treatments.

## Monitoring (4 minutes)

Each group should discuss the following points.

-   Devise an initial plan for tracking the spread and preventing new infections.
-   Identify critical locations for monitoring and how you would approach it.
