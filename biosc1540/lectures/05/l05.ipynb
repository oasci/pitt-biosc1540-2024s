    "\n",
    "The pKa measures a substance's acidity or basicity, particularly in chemistry.\n",
    "It is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of a solution.\n",
    "The pKa value helps quantify the strength of an acid in a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression for the acid dissociation constant (Ka), from which pKa is derived, is given by the following chemical equilibrium equation for a generic acid (HA) in water:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{A}^-\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium constant (Ka) for this reaction is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the dissociated ions ($\\text{H}^+$ and $\\text{A}^-$) to the undissociated acid ($\\text{HA}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Ka} = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the negative logarithm (base 10) of both sides of the equation gives the expression for pKa:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{pKa} = -\\log_{10}(\\text{Ka})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, the pKa is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for a given acid. A lower pKa indicates a stronger acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A lower pKa indicates a stronger acid because it means the acid is more likely to donate a proton (H+) in a chemical reaction.\n",
    "-   A higher pKa indicates a weaker acid as it is less likely to donate a proton.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pKa is a crucial parameter in understanding the behavior of acids and bases in various chemical reactions.\n",
    "It is commonly used in fields such as medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and environmental science to describe and predict the behavior of molecules in solution."

    "## Molecular descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular descriptors are quantitative representations of chemical compounds that capture various structural, electronic, and physicochemical properties.\n",
    "These descriptors are numerical values or sets of values that encode information about the characteristics of a molecule.\n",
    "Molecular descriptors provide a structured and standardized way to quantify molecular features, facilitating the analysis and comparison of different molecules in chemical and computational studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular descriptors can include a wide range of information, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Structural Descriptors: These describe the geometry and connectivity of atoms within a molecule. Examples include molecular weight, size, and shape descriptors.\n",
    "-   Topological Descriptors: These capture information about the connectivity of atoms in a molecular structure, often expressed as graphs or matrices.\n",
    "-   Electronic Descriptors: These reflect the electronic properties of a molecule, including features related to electron distribution, charge, and orbital energies.\n",
    "-   Physicochemical Descriptors: These encompass properties such as solubility, partition coefficients, and melting points, providing insights into the physical behavior of the molecule.\n",
    "-   Quantum Chemical Descriptors: These are derived from quantum mechanical calculations and provide detailed information about a molecule's electronic structure and energetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular descriptors are crucial in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, computational chemistry, and drug design.\n",
    "By converting complex molecular structures into numerical values, researchers can apply statistical and computational techniques to analyze and model the relationships between molecular features and various properties or activities.\n"

    "Before delving into regression analysis, it is essential to conduct a systematic review of the dataset.\n",
    "This preliminary examination will provide us with the necessary foundation to understand the quantitative relationships between molecular features and acidity.\n",
