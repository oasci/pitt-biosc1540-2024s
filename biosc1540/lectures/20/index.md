# Lecture 20

**Date:** Mar 21, 2024

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture.

1.  ðŸ§® Define binding free energy ($\Delta G_{bind}$) and explain its relationship to the binding affinity ($K_{eq}$).
2.  ðŸ§® Distinguish between enthalpic ($\Delta H_{bind}$) and entropic ($\Delta S_{bind}$) contributions to the binding free energy.
3.  ðŸ§® Identify and describe the key non-covalent interactions that promote protein-ligand binding.
4.  ðŸ§® Explain the role of point charges and multipole interactions in electrostatic forces and their impact on binding.
5.  ðŸ§® Discuss the concept of polarizability and its influence on induction effects in intermolecular interactions.
6.  ðŸ§® Recognize and describe the characteristics of specialized non-covalent interactions.
