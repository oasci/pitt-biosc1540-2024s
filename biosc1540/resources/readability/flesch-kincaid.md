# Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a readability test designed to assess the ease with which a reader can understand a written text.
It provides a numerical score that corresponds to a U.S. school grade level.
The test takes into account factors such as average sentence length and average number of syllables per word to estimate the readability of a piece of text.

The formula for calculating the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is:

$$
Grade level = 0.39 * \frac{total words}{total sentences} + 11.8 \frac{total syllables}{total words} - 15.59
$$

The result is usually a decimal number, which is then rounded to the nearest whole number to represent the corresponding U.S. school grade level.
For example, a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 8.5 would indicate that the text is readable by an average eighth-grade student.
Lower Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores generally suggest that a text is easier to comprehend, while higher scores indicate more complex and challenging language.
