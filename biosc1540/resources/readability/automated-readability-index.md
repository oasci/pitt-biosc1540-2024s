# Automated readability index

The Automated Readability Index (ARI) is a readability test that aims to assess the readability of a text by considering factors such as the average number of words per sentence and the average number of characters per word.
Like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the ARI provides a numerical score, but instead of correlating with a specific grade level, the score is often associated with the corresponding U.S. educational level.

The formula for calculating the Automated Readability Index is as follows:

$$
ARI = 4.71 \frac{Characters}{Words} + 0.5 \frac{Words}{Sentences} - 21.43
$$

The resulting ARI score is then interpreted as follows:

-   **Very easy to read (`1-6`)**: Very young children or individuals with limited reading abilities.
-   **Easy to read (`7-8`)**: Average 4th to 5th-grade students.
-   **Standard readability (`9-10`)**: Average 6th to 8th-grade students.
-   **Moderately difficult (`11-12`)**: High school students.
-   **Challenging (`13-14`)**: College students or educated adults.
-   **Very difficult (`15+`)**: Advanced degree holders or professionals.
