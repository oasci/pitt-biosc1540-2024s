# Scientist, Neuropsychiatry

**Company:** [Johnson & Johnson][company]

Successful candidate will actively engage in early discovery efforts to support Janssen’s Neuropsychiatry discovery strategy. The candidate will perform OMICs workflows, using primary neuron cultures, tissue slices and induced pluripotent stem cells. They will be responsible for the planning and hands-on execution of OMICs studies, lead all aspects of the generation and accurate recording of data in compliance with data integrity requirements, also play a role in data analysis, and interpret and effectively communicate the findings from OMICs data.
These efforts will help reveal underlying mechanistic disease biology and aid the development of novel disease-modifying therapies as well as in the identification of potential new drug targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Key Responsibilities:

-   Perform library construction and sequencing for single cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, epigenomics and other OMICs workflows.
-   Collaborate with computational scientists, biologists, and vendors and work within an extended team environment to support progress towards the project and team goals.
-   Prepare and record experimental reports that include detailed methods and materials, raw data, data analyses and graphs, and conclusions in the electronic laboratory notebook.
-   Follow laboratory safety and data integrity guidelines.
-   Present experimental results during group and project team meetings, and to internal and external scientific community through presentations and publications.

## Qualifications

Education:

-   a PhD degree with 0-3 years postdoctoral experience
-   OR a Master’s degree with a minimum of 8 years experience
-   OR a Bachelors Degree with a minimum of 12 years of experience in Neuroscience, Molecular Biology or a similar field is required

Experience and Skills:

Required:

-   A minimum of 5 years of hands-on experience in next generation sequencing technologies, such as bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics or epigenomics is required
-   This is a hands-on, lab-based role and the candidate being comfortable working in the laboratory is required
-   This individual must be a highly collaborative scientist who will be comfortable in both an individual contributor role and as part of a multidisciplinary research team
-   High motivation to contribute to research efforts to improve outcomes for patients suffering from psychiatric diseases is required

Preferred:

-   Experience in computational biology, data analysis and interpretation is preferred
-   Experience with implementation of new OMICs approaches for neuroscience applications is preferred

The anticipated base pay range for this position is MIN $102,000 to MAX $163,300.
