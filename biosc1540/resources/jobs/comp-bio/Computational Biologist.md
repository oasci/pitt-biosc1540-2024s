# Computational Biologist

**Company:** [United Therapeutics][company]

## How you’ll contribute

The Computational Lab for In Silico Molecular Biology is building a computational model of the lung to enable in silico design and testing of therapies for lung disease.
As part of this effort to develop an integrative multiscale lung model, the computational biologist will apply various mechanistic modeling techniques to simulate molecular and cellular processes related to lung physiology and pharmacology.
This is an onsite position 4 days/week in the Silver Spring, MD office, with the option to work from home 1 day/week.

-   Develop mathematical models of molecular and cellular processes in the lung, including but not limited to regulation of vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction, response to hypoxia, toxicity to airways/alveoli, and initiation/resolution of inflammation and fibrosis
-   Conduct research into approaches for mechanistic modeling of biological processes and determine suitability for specific applications
-   Integrate diverse data sources, such as in vitro cell culture, immunoassays, clinical measurement, and/or large-scale genomic and transcriptomic assays, into model development and calibration workflows
-   Implement procedures for model qualification to evaluate impact of uncertainty and variability on model output
-   Collaborate with other computational biologists and engineers to integrate models into large multiscale models spanning processes from organ to molecular level
-   Partner with internal and external labs to generate experimental data for model training/validation
-   Communicate results effectively through interactive visualizations, presentations at internal and external meetings, and peer-reviewed publications
-   Perform other duties as assigned

## Minimum Requirements

-   Master’s degree (MA/MS/MBA) in biomedical engineering, computational biology, or related field of study, and 6+ years of industry experience developing computational models of biological systems with a Master's degree OR Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in biomedical engineering, computational biology, or related field of study, and 2+ years of industry experience developing computational models of biological systems with a PhD. (Combination of PhD work and/or postdoctoral experience at a pharmaceutical/biotech company is acceptable.)
-   Expertise in one or more modeling formalisms for systems biology (e.g. differential equation, logic-based, or agent-based models)
-   Familiarity with quantitative systems pharmacology and other applications of modeling and simulation within pharmaceutical drug discovery and development
-   Expertise in numerical methods relevant to modeling and simulation, including solving systems of ordinary and/or partial differential equations, optimization, Monte Carlo methods
-   Fluency in one or more scientific programming languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia, and/or MATLAB)
-   Knowledge of molecular and cellular biology and drug development
-   Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences as demonstrated by record of presentations and publications

Preferred Qualifications

-   Ability to process and analyze large-scale genomic and transcriptomic datasets
-   Strong data visualization skills, including interactive visualization (e.g. R Shiny or d3.js)
-   Skilled in statistical and machine learning methods
-   Knowledge of pulmonary physiology
