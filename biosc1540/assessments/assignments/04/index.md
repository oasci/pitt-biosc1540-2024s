## Problem 6

While AlphaFold2 has made significant strides in protein structure prediction, it still has limitations.
Discuss these limitations and propose strategies or future developments to help overcome them.

## Problem 7

True or False?
Coevolutionary analysis can provide insights into protein-protein interactions and protein complex formation.

## Problem 8

Discuss the role of coevolutionary information in improving protein structure prediction accuracy.
How does the incorporation of coevolutionary data, such as that used by AlphaFold2, contribute to the success of these computational methods?

## Problem 9

AlphaFold2 generates multiple structures for a given protein sequence by:
