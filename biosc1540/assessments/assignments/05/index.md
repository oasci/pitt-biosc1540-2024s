Please submit your answers as a PDF to gradescope.

## Problem 1

**Points**: 7

Explain in simple terms the difference between the association constant ($K_a$) and the dissociation constant ($K_d$) and how they relate to binding affinity.
Would a ligand with a $K_d$ of 1 nM or 1 mM have a higher affinity for its target protein?

## Problem 2

**Points**: 6

Give an example of an intermolecular force that could contribute favorably to the enthalpy of binding between a drug molecule and its protein target.
Explain why this interaction is enthalpically favorable.

## Problem 3

**Points**: 6

Imagine you measured the binding of a drug to its target protein using two different biophysical techniques.
The first yielded an association rate constant ($k_{on}$) of 105 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and a dissociation rate constant ($k_{off}$) of 0.1 s<sup>-1</sup>.
The second directly measured a $K_d$ of 1 μM.
Are these results consistent with each other?
Show your reasoning.

## Problem 4

**Points**: 6

Explain the hydrophobic effect and how it relates to entropy.
Why do nonpolar solutes tend to aggregate in aqueous solution?
How might this influence the binding of a hydrophobic drug molecule to a buried pocket on a protein surface?

## Problem 5

**Points**: 6

Explain the difference between electrostatic and van der Waals interactions regarding the distance dependence of their potential energies.
Why are van der Waals interactions always attractive at short range, while electrostatic interactions can be attractive or repulsive?

## Problem 6

**Points**: 4

The affinity of some protein-ligand interactions strongly depends on salt concentration, decreasing rapidly as ionic strength increases.
Propose a plausible explanation for this phenomenon and describe a computational or wet-lab experiment you could perform to test your hypothesis.

## Problem 7

**Points**: 3

A common strategy in drug discovery is to make analogs of a lead compound by adding various substituents.
Imagine a compound with a $K_d$ of 10 nM that you want to improve by adding a substituent to form a new hydrogen bond with the protein.
Assuming no other enthalpic or entropic changes, estimate how much the new hydrogen bond interaction would need to contribute to the binding enthalpy (in kcal/mol) to achieve a 10-fold improvement ($K_d$ of 1 nM) in binding affinity.
You can assume reasonable biological conditions (i.e., temperature of 37 °C).

## Problem 8

**Points**: 2

Consider a fictitious multi-domain protein with two binding sites:

-   Site 1 is polar and solvent-exposed;
-   Site 2 is hydrophobic and buried in the core of the protein.

You measure the binding of two drug molecules with equal affinity ($K_d$ = 10 nM) but different physicochemical properties.

### Part A

Predict which site each drug likely binds to on the protein.
Justify your reasoning.

### Part B

Would you expect the binding to be dominated by enthalpy or entropy for each drug?
Explain your answer.

### Part C

Suppose you measure the binding of each drug again at a higher temperature and find that the affinity of Drug A decreases significantly ($K_d$ increases).
In contrast, the affinity of Drug B is relatively unchanged.
Provide a thermodynamic explanation for these observations.

### Part D

Next, you measure the binding of each drug in the presence of a high salt concentration.
The affinity of Drug A decreases dramatically, while the affinity of Drug B increases slightly.
Propose a molecular basis for these effects.

### Part E

Finally, you determine the crystal structure of the protein-drug complexes and discover that both drugs cause significant conformational changes in the protein upon binding.
Drug A induces the ordering of a flexible loop near its binding site, while Drug B causes a large domain rearrangement that buries additional hydrophobic surface area.
How might these conformational changes influence each drug's binding energetics ($\Delta G$, $\Delta H$, $−T \Delta S$)?
Discuss the potential entropic and enthalpic consequences.
