# Portfolio

The main deliverable of this course is a computational biology portfolio.
Each module will contribute a portfolio section and are called [checkpoints](../checkpoints/) with their own criteria.
At the end of the semester, your portfolio will be evaluated in its entirety with all module [checkpoints](../checkpoints/).
Thus, changes and corrections can be made to previous [checkpoints](../checkpoints/) for the final submission.

You are encouraged to publish your portfolio online; for example, on your [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.
This will help you showcase your skills to your future employers or applications.
