# Genomics

Our first portfolio checkpoint will involve a genomics-themed project involving *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*).
In the realm of biomedical research, *E. coli* is a foundational model organism and is characterized by its genetic simplicity and relevance in elucidating fundamental biological processes.

As we embark on our genomics-themed project, the focal point shifts towards addressing a pressing global concern&mdash;antibiotic resistance.
The urgency surrounding antibiotic resistance has become increasingly palpable and poses a significant threat to public health worldwide.
The primary drivers of antibiotic resistance include practices such as the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, inadequate infection prevention and control, and the scarcity of new antibiotic developments.
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, coupled with a dwindling arsenal of effective antibiotics, has propelled this issue to the forefront of medical challenges.

To tackle this multifaceted problem, we explore an innovative tool of a computational model designed to predict antibiotic susceptibility in *E. coli* infections.
At the core of our project lies the synergy of genomics and machine learning.
Armed with datasets containing whole-genome sequencing information and antibiotic susceptibility data, our approach seeks to train a model capable of predicting the antibiotics to which a particular *E. coli* strain may be susceptible.
Rapid and accurate predictions of antibiotic susceptibility have the potential to revolutionize antibiotic prescription practices, contributing significantly to the fight against antibiotic resistance.
