# Cell stressors

In our project on analyzing gene expression under specific stress conditions, it's crucial to understand the experimental setup and the nature of the cell stressors used in the study.
This information provides a backdrop against which we analyze the gene expression data, allowing us to interpret changes in expression within the environmental context in which they were observed.

## Background on Experimental Medium

The study utilized a modified M9 liquid medium as the standard environment for *E. coli* cultures, comprising:

-   7.1 g/L of Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> · 12H<sub>2</sub>O,
-   3 g/L of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,
-   0.5 g/L of NaCl,
-   2 g/L of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,
-   123 mg/L of MgSO<sub>4</sub> · 7H<sub>2</sub>O,
-   2.78 mg/L of FeSO<sub>4</sub> · 7H<sub>2</sub>O,
-   14.7 mg/L of CaCl<sub>2</sub> · 2H<sub>2</sub>O,
-   10 mg/L of thiamine-hydrochloride,
-   5 g/L of glucose.

This composition serves as the default condition for the *E. coli* cultures, against which the stress responses are measured.

## Cell Stressors Examined

The investigators introduced various cell stressors to the *E. coli* cultures to study their impact on gene expression.
Below is a summary of each stressor and its specific stress condition:

1.  **Sodium chloride (NaCl)** - 400 mM: High concentrations can induce osmotic and oxidative stress, affecting cell turgor, function, and leading to potential cell damage or death.
2.  **Potassium chloride (KCl)** - 210 mM: Similar to NaCl, high levels of KCl can also create osmotic stress.
3.  **Cobalt chloride (CoCl₂)** - 16 μM: Introduces metal stress, which can affect various cellular processes.
4.  **Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃)** - 32.5 mM: Alkaline stress can disturb pH homeostasis, affecting enzyme activities and stability.
5.  **L-Lactate (Lac)** - 40 mM: Organic acid stress that can affect metabolism and pH balance.
6.  **L-Malate (Mal)** - 30 mM: Another organic acid stress impacting metabolism and energy production.
7.  **Methacrylate (MCL)** - 8.75 mM: A synthetic compound that can cause stress through its toxic effects.
8.  **Crotonate (CRO)** - 50 mM: Introduces stress potentially through its effects on metabolic pathways.
9.  **Methylglyoxal (MG)** - 350 μM: A byproduct of metabolism that, in high concentrations, can cause glycation damage.
10.  **n-butanol (BuOH)** - 1.25%: Solvent stress that can disrupt cell membranes and protein function.
11.  **Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)** - 4.8 μM: Surfactant stress that can interfere with membrane integrity and function.
