In the previous module, we used *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) as a model organism for combating antibiotic resistance.
However, just because *E. coli* can be a bad guy by causing foodborne illnesses and gastrointestinal infections.
But this does not mean [it is a bad guy :fontawesome-brands-youtube:][zangief-bad-guy].
*E. coli* is a cornerstone in biotechnology and serves as a versatile and widely employed microorganism.
Its well-characterized genetics, rapid growth, and ease of manipulation make it an invaluable tool for the production of recombinant proteins, vaccines, and bio-based chemicals.

This project will explore *E. coli* gene expression profiles under various stress conditions, with the ultimate aim of genetically engineering strains endowed with higher stress tolerance.
We will look at a diverse range of stressors, each offering unique challenges in various industrial and environmental contexts.
For example,

-   high-temperature environments encountered in biofuel production;
-   oxidative stress in bioremediation processes;
-   broader pH ranges for fermentation and bioremediation;
-   higher salt tolerance for bio-based chemical and enzymes;
-   radiation resistance for radioactive site cleanup;
-   enhanced nutrient utilization for robust growth.

Our endeavor is not confined solely to specific stressors; rather, we aim to bolster the overall stress response networks in E. coli.
This approach offers a generalized improvement in the bacterium's ability to withstand dynamic and unpredictable environmental conditions, thereby expanding its applicability in a broader spectrum of biotechnological applications.
