    "The teaching team has meticulously crafted this evaluation checkpoint to minimize you writing Python code from scratch.\n",
    "Throughout the assessment, you will encounter several comments, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DO NOT MODIFY CODE BELOW THIS LINE.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This directive ensures that the code following the comment remains uniform across all submissions, thereby standardizing the evaluation process.\n",
    "If you inadvertently alter any part of this pre-written code, or if the teaching team advises a modification, you must restore the original code by copying and pasting the correct version directly [from website](https://pitt-biosc1540-2024s.oasci.org/assessments/checkpoints/transcriptomics/transcriptomics-checkpoint/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Any rubric item that you need to fill out will be indicated with either a `STUDENT TODO:` or assigning some variable as instructed.\n",
    "Because most of the Python has been written for you, the rubric is based on your decisions and explanations.\n",
