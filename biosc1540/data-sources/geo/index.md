# Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

**Website:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/][ncbi-geo]

The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository that archives and freely distributes comprehensive sets of microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomic data submitted by the scientific community.
In addition to data storage, a collection of web-based interfaces and applications are available to help users query and download the studies and gene expression patterns stored in GEO.

 The three main goals of GEO are to:

-   Provide a robust, versatile database in which to efficiently store high-throughput functional genomic data (see Data organization)
-   Offer simple submission procedures and formats that support complete and well-annotated data deposits from the research community (see Submission guide)
-   Provide user-friendly mechanisms that allow users to query, locate, review and download studies and gene expression profiles of interest (see Query and analysis)

## GEO DataSets

The [GEO DataSets][ncbi-gds] database stores original submitter-supplied records (Series, Samples and Platforms) as well as curated DataSets.
See the Overview for information about these different records types and how they are are related to each other.

Curated DataSets form the basis of GEO's advanced data display and analysis features, including tools to identify differences in gene expression levels and cluster heatmaps.
GEO Profiles are derived from GEO DataSets.
Not all original submitter-supplied records have been assembled into curated DataSets yet.

The GEO DataSets database can be searched using many different attributes including keywords, organism, DataSet type and authors.
Examples and full details about how to search for GEO DataSets of interest are provided in the Querying GEO DataSets and GEO Profiles page.

Information about how to interpret GEO DataSets results pages and how to use the Data Analysis Tools is provided within the following annotated screenshots.

## GEO Profiles

The [GEO Profiles][ncbi-geo-profiles] database stores gene expression profiles derived from curated GEO DataSets.
Each Profile is presented as a chart that displays the expression level of one gene across all Samples within a DataSet.
Experimental context is provided in the bars along the bottom of the charts making it possible to see at a glance whether a gene is differentially expressed across different experimental conditions.
Profiles have various types of links including internal links that connect genes that exhibit similar behavior, and external links to relevant records in other NCBI databases.

GEO Profiles can be searched using many different attributes including keywords, gene symbols, gene names, GenBank accession numbers, or Profiles flagged as being differentially expressed.
Examples and full details about how to search for GEO Profiles of interest are provided in the Querying GEO DataSets and GEO Profiles page.

Information about how GEO Profiles are generated, and how to use and interpret GEO Profiles results pages and charts is provided within the following annotated screenshots.
