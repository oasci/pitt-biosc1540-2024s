# Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

**Website:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/][ncbi-geo]

The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository that archives and freely distributes comprehensive sets of microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomic data submitted by the scientific community.
In addition to data storage, a collection of web-based interfaces and applications are available to help users query and download the studies and gene expression patterns stored in GEO.

 The three main goals of GEO are to:

-   Provide a robust, versatile database in which to efficiently store high-throughput functional genomic data (see Data organization)
-   Offer simple submission procedures and formats that support complete and well-annotated data deposits from the research community (see Submission guide)
-   Provide user-friendly mechanisms that allow users to query, locate, review and download studies and gene expression profiles of interest (see Query and analysis)
