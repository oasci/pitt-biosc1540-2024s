[Gene][ncbi-gene] supplies gene-specific connections in the nexus of map, sequence, expression, structure, function, citation, and homology data.
Unique identifiers are assigned to genes with defining sequences, genes with known map positions, and genes inferred from phenotypic information.
These gene identifiers are used throughout NCBI's databases and tracked through updates of annotation.
Gene includes genomes represented by NCBI Reference Sequences (or RefSeqs) and is integrated for indexing and query and retrieval from NCBI's Entrez and E-Utilities systems.
Gene comprises sequences from thousands of distinct taxonomic identifiers, ranging from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes.
It represents chromosomes, organelles, plasmids, viruses, transcripts, and millions of proteins.
