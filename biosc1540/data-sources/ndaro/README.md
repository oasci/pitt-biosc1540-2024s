# National Database of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms (NDARO)

The NCBI National Database of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms (NDARO) is a collaborative, cross-agency, centralized hub for researchers to access AMR data to facilitate real-time surveillance of pathogenic organisms.

## Why it matters

Antibiotics have been a staple of modern medicine's toolkit to fight illnesses, but antibiotic treatment has become less reliable as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has evolved in many bacterial pathogens, causing the need for costly new treatments to be developed, while antimicrobial resistant organisms continue to take thousands of lives per year.
AMR is a growing concern that affects a wide variety of people, including those within the medical community, public health officials, food producers, pharmaceutical develops, and the general public.

## What we do

In response to the rising threat of AMR, the White House developed the [National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/03/27/our-plan-combat-and-prevent-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria) in 2015.
As part of the National Action Plan, NCBI is partnered with several outside agencies, including the FDA, CDC, USDA, WHO, PHE, and others to take the following steps:

-   To increase standardization, NCBI has developed and maintains a curated database of AMR genes and makes them available both as raw data and with an interactive web interface.
-   To make AMR-related data more widely available, NCBI is collecting genetic and antibiotic susceptibility data.
-   To make more effective use of bacterial genomic data, NCBI has developed AMRFinderPlus to identify AMR genes in bacterial genomes.
-   To assist researchers and public health officials, NCBI has developed the Isolate Browser and MicroBIGG-E to allow researchers to identify bacterial genomes with AMR genes.
