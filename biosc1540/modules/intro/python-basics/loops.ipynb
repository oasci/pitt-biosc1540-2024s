    "These functions do not `return` one value, but they repeatedly `yield` one value at a time.\n",

    "It does not ask `range` to give it numbers.\n",
    "In actuality, we need to use `list()` instead.\n",
    "This function still creates a list, but it is designed to ask whatever is in between `()` to keep handing it values until it runs out.\n",
