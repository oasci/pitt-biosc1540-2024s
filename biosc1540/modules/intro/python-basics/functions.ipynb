    "But first, we need a [recipe](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-chip-cookies/).\n",

    "\n",
    "-   1 cup salted butter softened\n",
    "-   2 cups granulated sugar\n",
    "-   2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n",
    "-   2 large eggs\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.\n",

    "2.  In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.\n",
    "    Set aside.\n",

    "4.  Beat in eggs and vanilla until light (about 1 minute).\n",
    "5.  Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.\n",
    "6.  Add chocolate chips and mix well.\n",
    "7.  Roll 2-3 Tablespoons (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.\n",

    "-   2 tablespoons water\n",
    "-   1/2 teaspoon vanilla\n",

    "with the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Preheat the oven to 325¬∞F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.\n",
    "2.  In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.\n",
    "3.  In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.\n",
    "4.  Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.\n",
    "5.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the top.\n",
