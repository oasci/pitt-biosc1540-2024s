    "-   2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n",
    "-   2 large eggs\n",

    "-   1 teaspoon sea salt\n",
    "-   2 cups chocolate chips (14 oz)\n",
    "\n",
    "with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.\n",
    "    Line three baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\n",
    "2.  In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.\n",
    "    Set aside.\n",

    "5.  Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.\n",
    "6.  Add chocolate chips and mix well.\n",
    "7.  Roll 2-3 Tablespoons (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.\n",
    "8.  Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just barely starting to turn brown.\n",
