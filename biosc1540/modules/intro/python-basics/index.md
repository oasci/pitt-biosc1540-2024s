# Python basics

There are a ton of resources to learn the basics of Python and I cannot necessarily write better ones.
Here are some options I recommend&mdash;in decreasing order&mdash;along with what sections will be relevant for this course.

-   [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
-   [kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/): "Intro to Programming", "Intro to Machine Learning", "Python", and "Pandas" courses.
-   [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/): "Learn the Basics" and "Data Science Tutorials".
-   [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python): Everything.
-   [Byte of Python](https://python.oasci.org/external/byte-of-python/): Everything

I am a huge fan of the [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) website; it is my go-to place for learning more about Python.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expectations

The main purpose of this section is to give you a basic understanding of programming in Python.
You do not need to be an expert programmer, and you will never be graded on how well you code in Python.
This is just to get you some fundamentals so that later in the course your focus can be on computational biology and not Python.
