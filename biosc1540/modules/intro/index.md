# 01 - Introduction

## Learning objectives

-   🧫 🧮 Explore the integration of computer science techniques to address complex problems in computational biology.
-   🐍 Be comfortable with the syntax and semantics of Python programming language.
-   🐍 Apply Python skills to write and execute basic scripts, demonstrating fundamental programming competence.
-   🐍 Demonstrate understanding of core Python concepts (variables, data types, control flow) for effective problem-solving.
-   🐍 Proficiently use biological data using Python libraries, with a focus on Pandas and NumPy.
-   🐍 Use Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create visually compelling plots that communicate complex biological data effectively.
-   🐍 🧮 🤖 Develop an understanding of clustering concepts and implement common algorithms to identify patterns in biological data.
-   🐍 🧮 🤖 Implement regression models to capture relationships within biological variables.
