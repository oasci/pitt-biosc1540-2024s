# Computational biology

**Computational biology**
: An amorphous term that encompasses any application of computational methods to obtain insight into biological phenomena.

This is intentionally broad because I could not find a more specific description that everyone agreed on.
[Wikipedia][wiki-comp-bio] defines it as

> the use of data analysis, mathematical modeling, and computational simulations to understand biological systems and relationships.

This is derived from an [NIH document][nih-comp-bio] from more than 24 years ago and is still relevant today.
Scopes of scientific journals for computational biology are another way we could define the field.
The [Journal of Computational Biology][j-comp-bio] establishes its scope as

> the development and application of new methods in computational biology, including algorithmic, statistical, mathematical, machine learning, and artificial intelligence contributions.

and [PLOS Computational Biology][plos-comp-bio] as contributions that

> further our understanding of living systems at all scales&mdash;from molecules and cells to patient populations and ecosystems&mdash;through the application of computational methods.
