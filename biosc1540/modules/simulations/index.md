# 05 - Molecular simulations

!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

## Learning objectives

-   Define molecular simulations and articulate their significance in computational biology.
-   Differentiate between classical and quantum mechanics in the context of force fields.
-   Describe the potential energy surfaces involved in molecular mechanics.
-   Outline the key steps in the setup phase of a molecular simulation.
-   Analyze the equilibration phase, including temperature and pressure control.
-   Apply trajectory analysis techniques to interpret simulation results.
-   Utilize visualization tools for the effective communication of molecular dynamics outcomes.
-   Apply RMSD and RMSF analysis to assess structural changes in biomolecular systems.
-   Interpret free energy landscapes and recognize their importance in structural dynamics.
-   Justify the importance of rare events in biomolecular systems.
-   Illustrate the application of rare event sampling in the context of protein folding, unfolding, and ligand binding.
-   Evaluate the computational resources and scalability challenges in molecular simulations.
-   Analyze the accuracy and limitations of force fields.
-   Discuss advances in hardware and software impacting the field and anticipate future trends.
