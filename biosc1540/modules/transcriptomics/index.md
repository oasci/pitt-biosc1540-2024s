### Textbooks

-   [**[sobti2023genomics]**](https://www.routledge.com/Bioinformatics-and-Computational-Biology-Technological-Advancements-Applications/Singh-Saini-Comar-Junior/p/book/9781032361581):[^1] Transcriptomics is scattered throughout some chapters; however, it is always introduced in a niche context.

-   [**[gonzaga2021genomics]**](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/C2019-0-01157-0):[^2] Genetics and genomic in the context of rare diseases.
    This does have one chapter on RNA-seq and transcriptomics.

-   [**[ismail2023bioinformatics]**](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119698005):[^3] TODO:

-   [**[low2023practical]**](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/12908):[^4] TODO:

-   [**[ramsden2023bioinformatics]**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-45607-8):[^5] Comprehensive text on many topics central to bioinformatics such as biology, information theory, and omics.
    Text is more beginner to intermediate for non-biology topics.
    Also has applications that connect the material to real-world topics.
