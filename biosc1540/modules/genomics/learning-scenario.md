# Genomic approaches for predicting and monitoring antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistance[^1] poses a significant global health threat.
The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has significantly hindered the effectiveness of current antibiotic treatments.
Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in clinical, agricultural, and veterinary settings have further accelerated the evolution of resistant strains.
There is a pressing need for innovative strategies to combat this growing crisis.

Genomics, the study of an organism's complete set of DNA, provides a powerful tool to understand the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance.
By analyzing bacterial strains' genomic data, researchers can identify key genetic markers associated with resistance, paving the way for the development of targeted and personalized treatment approaches.

Genomics is employed in the study of antibiotic resistance because it can uncover the molecular mechanisms that underpin resistance traits.
Traditional methods of identifying antibiotic-resistant strains rely on time-consuming culture-based techniques, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
Genomic approaches offer a rapid and comprehensive alternative, enabling clinicians to predict resistance patterns, tailor treatment regimens, and monitor the emergence of resistance in real time.

## Objectives

### Genomic profiling

This objective involves comprehensively examining the entire genomic landscape of bacterial strains demonstrating varying degrees of antibiotic resistance.
We aim to construct a rich and representative dataset by collecting samples from a wide range of sources, including clinical settings, hospitals, and communities.
Through this genomic profiling initiative, we seek to unravel the intricate genetic makeup of antibiotic-resistant strains, providing a foundational understanding of the genomic basis for resistance phenomena.

### Identification of resistance genes

This objective entails a sophisticated exploration of genomic data through the adept application of bioinformatics tools and databases.
The goal is to identify specific genes and mutations that underlie antibiotic resistance.
In addition to scrutinizing well-documented resistance mechanisms, we aspire to unearth novel genetic determinants contributing to resistance phenotypes.
By discerning the genetic signatures associated with resistance, we aim to deepen our comprehension of the intricate interplay between bacterial genomes and the development of antibiotic resistance.

### Development of predictive models

This objective seeks to transcend traditional approaches by developing predictive models that anticipate antibiotic resistance based on genomic data.
By training these models with the genomic profiles of known resistant strains, we aim to equip them to discern subtle patterns and correlations indicative of resistance.
Validating these models against clinical outcomes ensures their accuracy and efficacy in forecasting antibiotic resistance, thereby empowering healthcare practitioners with proactive and targeted treatment strategies.
