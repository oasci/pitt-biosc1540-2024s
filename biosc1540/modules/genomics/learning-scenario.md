**Genomic approaches for predicting and monitoring antibiotic resistance**

## Background

Antibiotic resistance[^1] poses a significant global health threat.
Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has significantly hindered the effectiveness of current antibiotic treatments.
Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in clinical, agricultural, and veterinary settings have further accelerated the evolution of resistant strains.
There is pressing need for innovative strategies to combat this growing crisis.

Genomics, the study of an organism's complete set of DNA, provides a powerful tool to understand the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance.
By analyzing the genomic data of bacterial strains, researchers can identify key genetic markers associated with resistance, paving the way for the development of targeted and personalized treatment approaches.

The motivation behind employing genomics in the study of antibiotic resistance lies in its ability to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underpin resistance traits.
Traditional methods of identifying antibiotic-resistant strains rely on time-consuming culture-based techniques, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
Genomic approaches offer a rapid and comprehensive alternative, enabling clinicians to predict resistance patterns, tailor treatment regimens, and monitor the emergence of resistance in real-time.
