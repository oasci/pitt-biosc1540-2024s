# de Bruijn

De Bruijn graphs are a powerful and intuitive way to represent overlaps between sequences of symbols, and they have found significant applications in bioinformatics, particularly in the assembly of genomes from nucleotide sequences.
Here, we will explore what de Bruijn graphs are, how they are constructed from nucleotide sequences (specifically focusing on k-mers), and why they are so useful in the context of genome assembly.
