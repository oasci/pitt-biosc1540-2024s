# Second generation

Second-generation sequencing technologies, or next-generation sequencing (NGS), are DNA sequencing methods that emerged in the mid to late 1990s and were implemented in commercial DNA sequencers by 2000.
These methods use miniaturized and parallelized platforms to sequence 1 million to 43 billion short reads (50 to 400 bases each) per instrument run.
