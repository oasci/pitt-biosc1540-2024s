# Third generation

The next era of DNA sequencing technology, termed third-generation sequencing (TGS), has gained a place in biology as a way to study genomes, transcriptomes, and metagenomes at an unprecedented resolution.
These technologies work by single-molecule sequencing and provide:

-   Long reads with no amplification.
-   Direct detection of epigenetic modifications on native DNA.
-   Direct sequencing through regions of the genome inaccessible or difficult to analyze by short-read platforms.
-   Uniform coverage of the genome as they are not as sensitive to GC content as short-read platforms.

There are several companies currently at the heart of third generation sequencing technology development; namely, [Pacific Biosciences](https://www.pacb.com/), [Oxford Nanopore Technology](https://nanoporetech.com/), [Quantapore](https://quantapore.com/).
These companies are taking fundamentally different approaches to sequencing single DNA molecules.
