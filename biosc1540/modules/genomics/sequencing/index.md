# Sequencing

DNA sequencing is a laboratory technique that involves determining the order of nucleotides, or bases, in a DNA molecule.
The sequence of these bases, which are often abbreviated as A, T, C, and G, encodes the biological information that cells use to develop and operate.
The process of sequencing DNA is crucial to understanding the function of genes and other parts of the genome.

There are several different methods available for DNA sequencing, each with its own characteristics.
The most common methods include Sanger sequencing, which is a chain-termination method that uses dideoxynucleotides to halt DNA strand elongation, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, which are high-throughput techniques that can process a large number of DNA molecules quickly.
Other methods include Maxam-Gilbert sequencing, hybridization-based sequencing, and nanopore sequencing.

The development of additional methods represents an active area of genomics research.
These methods are used in many areas of biology and other sciences such as medicine, forensics, and anthropology.
DNA sequencing has become a key technology in molecular biology, allowing researchers to identify changes in genes and noncoding DNA, associations with diseases and phenotypes, and potential drug targets.
