# Python basics

There are a ton of resources to learn the basics of Python and I cannot necessarily write better ones.
Here are some options I recommend&mdash;in decreasing order&mdash;along with what sections will be relevant for this course.

-   [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
-   [kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/): "Intro to Programming", "Intro to Machine Learning", "Python", and "Pandas" courses.
-   [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/): "Learn the Basics" and "Data Science Tutorials".
-   [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python): Everything.
-   [Byte of Python](https://python.oasci.org/external/byte-of-python/): Everything

I know this is not a Python course, and you will never be graded on how good your Python code is.
All that matters is that it runs in a reasonable amount of time and I can understand what your code is trying to do.
