    "\n",
    "The local variable (`x` inside the function) only exists for the duration of the function call. These variables are created when the function is called and cease to exist once the function's execution is completed.\n",
    "This temporary existence helps prevent variable name conflicts and ensures that each function call has its own isolated space for variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "**During the function call**<br>\n",
    "When the function is called, a parameter `x` is created as a local variable within the function's scope.\n",
    "It is initialized with the value of the argument passed during the function call.\n",
    "Subsequently, within the function, the local variable `x` is reassigned a new value.\n",
    "This reassignment only affects the local variable and does not impact the global variable with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the function call**<br>\n",
    "Once the function call is complete, the local variable `x` that existed within the function is destroyed. The memory allocated to this local variable is released.\n",
    "Importantly, the destruction of the local variable does not affect the global variable `x`, which maintains its original value and remains unaffected by the changes made within the function."

    "It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined outside a function without the `global` statement.\n",
    "\n",

However, this is not encouraged and should be avoided since it becomes unclear to the reader of the program as to where that variable's definition is.\n",
