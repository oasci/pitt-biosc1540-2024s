    "It is initialized with the value of the argument passed during the function call.\n",
    "Subsequently, within the function, the local variable `x` is reassigned a new value.\n",
    "This reassignment only affects the local variable and does not impact the global variable with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the function call**<br>\n",
    "Once the function call is complete, the local variable `x` that existed within the function is destroyed. The memory allocated to this local variable is released.\n",
