# Computational biology

!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

**Computational biology**
: An amorphous term that encompasses any application of computational methods to obtain insight into biological phenomena.

This is intentionally broad because I could not find a more specific description that everyone agreed on.
[Wikipedia][wiki-comp-bio] defines it as

> the use of data analysis, mathematical modeling, and computational simulations to understand biological systems and relationships.

This is derived from an [NIH document][nih-comp-bio] from more than 24 years ago and is still relevant today.
Scopes of scientific journals for computational biology are another way we could define the field.
The [Journal of Computational Biology][j-comp-bio] establishes its scope as

> Journal of Computational Biology publishes articles whose primary contributions are the development and application of new methods in computational biology, including algorithmic, statistical, mathematical, machine learning, and artificial intelligence contributions.

and [PLOS Computational Biology][plos-comp-bio] as contributions that

> further our understanding of living systems at all scales&mdash;from molecules and cells, to patient populations and ecosystems&mdash;through the application of computational methods.

## Two subfields

TODO:

!!! attention

    This is the instructors interpretation of the field.

### Bioinformatics

### Computational modeling

## Scientific journals

In 2024, [Clarivate][clarivate] has indexed 62 journals that scope primarily encompasses computational biology.
Journals with broader scope such as Science and Nature also contain computational biology research, so this number is much higher.
