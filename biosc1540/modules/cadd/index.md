# 04 - Computer-aided drug design

!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

## Learning objectives

-   Define the drug discovery pipeline and articulate its key stages.
-   Identify and describe the significance of each stage in the drug discovery process.
-   Recognize the role of computer-aided drug design within the broader drug discovery context.
-   Understand the principles of molecular docking and its applications in drug discovery.
-   Differentiate between ligand-based and structure-based docking approaches.
-   Evaluate the challenges and limitations associated with molecular docking.
-   Define scoring functions and explain their importance in virtual screening.
-   Classify different types of scoring functions and analyze their characteristics.
-   Evaluate and compare the performance of scoring functions in drug design.
-   Comprehend the basics of ligand-based screening, including molecular descriptors and fingerprints.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of pharmacophore modeling and QSAR.
-   Define lead optimization and its role in refining drug candidates.
-   Analyze structure-activity relationships (SAR) in the context of medicinal chemistry and drug design.
-   Analyze real-world applications and success stories of computer-aided drug design.
