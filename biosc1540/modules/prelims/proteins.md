# Proteins

Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules.
Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes.
Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function.
Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly.
They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.

## Types and functions of proteins

Enzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins.
Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on.
The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions.
Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes.
It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts.
An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.

Hormones are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction.
For example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level.

Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous.
For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein.
Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds.
Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as denaturation.
All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids.

## Amino Acids

Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins.
Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of a central carbon atom, also known as the alpha ($\alpha$) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH~2~), a carboxyl group (COOH), and to a hydrogen atom.
Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as the R group (Figure 1).

    </figure>

    Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain (R group) are attached.

The name "amino acid" is derived from the fact that they contain both an amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic structure. For each amino acid, the R group (or side chain) is different (Figure 2).

!!! quote "Figure 2"

    <figure markdown>
    ![20 canonical amino acids](https://bio.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/955/Figure_03_04_02.jpg){ alight=left width=600 }
    </figure>

    There are 20 amino acids coded for directly by codons of the genetic code, each with a different R group (variant group) that determines its chemical nature.

The chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar). For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an amino acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain

Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known by the letter V or the three-letter code val.

The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein's shape, size, and function. Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of water. The resulting bond is the peptide bond

    </figure>

    Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked to the amino group of the incoming amino acid.
    In the process, a molecule of water is released.

The products formed by such linkages are called peptides.
As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a polypeptide.
Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end.
This end is called the N-terminal, or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C- or carboxyl terminal.
The terms "polypeptide" and "protein" are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is more formally used for a polypeptide or  that have combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function.

After protein synthesis (translation), most proteins are modified.
These are known as post-translational modifications.
They may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation (addition of a phosphate group), or may require the addition of other chemical groups.
Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.

## Protein Structure

The shape of a protein is critical to its function.
For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at a site known as the active site.
If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate.
To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

### Primary

The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure.
For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds.
The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is glycine, whereas the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 4).
The sequences of amino acids in the A and B chains are unique to insulin.

    </figure>

    Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone made of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30 amino acids long).
    In each chain, primary structure is indicated by three-letter abbreviations that represent the names of the amino acids in the order they are present.
    The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain.
    Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond.
    Two disulfide bonds connect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the correct shape.
    Note that all disulfide bonds are the same length, but are drawn different sizes for clarity.

The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene encoding the protein.
A change in nucleotide sequence of the gene's coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function.

In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin $\beta$ chain (a small
portion of which is shown in Figure 5) has a single amino acid
substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function.
Specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in
the beta chain. What is most remarkable to consider is that a
hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains
that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore,
has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal
hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule- -- which dramatically
decreases life expectancy -- is a single amino acid of the 600. What is
even more remarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by
three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base
change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases.

    The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to sickle cell anemia.
    In normal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate.
    In sickle cell hemoglobin, this glutamate is replaced by a valine.

Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells and assume a crescent or "sickle" shape, which clogs arteries (Figure 6).
This can lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those affected by this disease.

### Secondary

The local folding of polypeptides gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein.
The most common are the $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-pleated sheet structures (Figure 7).
Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds.
The hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another amino acid that is four amino acids farther along the chain.

!!! quote "Figure 7"

    <figure markdown>
    ![](https://bio.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/961/Figure_03_04_07.jpg){ alight=left width=600 }
    </figure>

    The $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone.
    Certain amino acids have a propensity to form an $\alpha$-helix, while others have a propensity to form a $\beta$-pleated sheet.

Every helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues.
The R groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide protrude out from the $\alpha$-helix chain.
In the $\beta$-pleated sheet, the "pleats" are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain.
The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the folds of the pleat.
The pleated segments align parallel or antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide backbone.
The $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-pleated sheet structures are found in most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an important structural
role.

### Tertiary

The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure (Figure 8).
This structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain.
Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein.
The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures.
For example, R groups with like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds).
When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside.
The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.
Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond forming during protein folding.

!!! quote "Figure 8"

    <figure markdown>
    ![](https://bio.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/962/Figure_03_04_08.jpg){ alight=left width=600 }
    </figure>

    The tertiary structure of proteins is determined by a variety of chemical interactions.
    These include hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding and disulfide linkages.

All of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein.
When a protein loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.

### Quaternary

In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure.
Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure.
For example, insulin (a globular protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that cause it to be mostly clumped into a ball shape.
Insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of post-translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together.
Silk (a fibrous protein), however, has a $\beta$-pleated sheet structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.

The four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) are illustrated in Figure 9.

## Denaturation and protein folding

Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that are held together by chemical interactions.
If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation.
Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function.
Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function.
One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried.
The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling.
The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions.

Protein folding is critical to its function.
It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process.
Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process.
They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.

## Summary

Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell.
They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones.
The building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids.
Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain.
There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the R group.
Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond.
A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide.

Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional) quaternary.
The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids.
The local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the $\alpha$ helix and $\beta$-pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure.
The overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary structure.
When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein.
Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.

## Free Response

??? question "Explain what happens if even one amino acid is substituted for another in a polypeptide chain. Provide a specific example."

    A change in gene sequence can lead to a different amino acid being added to a polypeptide chain instead of the normal one.
    This causes a change in protein structure and function.
    For example, in sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin $\beta$ chain has a single amino acid substitution&mdash;the amino acid glutamic acid in position six is substituted by valine.
    Because of this change, hemoglobin molecules form aggregates, and the disc-shaped red blood cells assume a crescent shape, which results in serious health problems.

??? question "Describe the differences in the four protein structures."

    The sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure.
    The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions is the secondary structure of the protein.
    The three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure, created in part by chemical interactions such as hydrogen bonds between polar side chains, van der Waals interactions, disulfide linkages, and hydrophobic interactions.
    Some proteins are formed from multiple polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure.
