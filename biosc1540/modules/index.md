# Modules

Content here provides curated resources relevant for learning course material.

## Learning objectives

Computational biology is at the intersection of several fields and this course is no different.
Each module will cover learning objectives simultaneously across four categories.

-   🧫 **Biology**: cellular and molecular biology, physiology, microbiology.
-   🐍 **Python**: programming, data processing, visualization.
-   🧮 **Algorithms**: methods, simulations, techniques, mathematics.
-   🤖 **Machine learning**: regression, dimensionality reduction, neural networks.

!!! note

    We will use icons to quickly communicate what categories are relevant to the respective material.

## Learning scenarios

In this course, each module will be anchored by a meticulously designed learning scenario.
These scenarios serve as compelling narratives, carefully crafted to elucidate the practical and real-world relevance of the computational biology concepts.
