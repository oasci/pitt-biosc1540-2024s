This course offers a systematic examination of foundational concepts, comprehensive proficiency in Python applications, and an in-depth understanding of the significant fields of computational biology.
Students learn about genomics, transcriptomics, computer-aided drug design, and molecular simulations in the context of current research applications.
We focus primarily on hands-on learning with projects centered around *E. coli* as our computational model organism.
Ultimately, this course is the first stepping stone for undergraduates at the University of Pittsburgh before taking Genomics (BIOSC 1542) and/or Simulation and Modeling (BIOSC 1544).

## Acknowledgements

Dr. Nathan Brouwer deserves immense gratitude for dedicating years to the development of this course.
I am lucky to benefit from your insight and hard work in previous semesters.
I also appreciate that you switched to Python üêç before I taught this course because I do not know R (yet).

In our Friday morning meetings, Dr. Dan Wetzel has provided valuable scaffolding insight for the course while consistently providing encouragement and support.
His dedication and contributions have set the tone for success in my teaching endeavors.

Dr. Danielle Spitzer has been a standout pillar of support and pedagogical guidance throughout this journey.
Her encouragement to continually strive for improvement resonates in every exchange, creating a warm and motivating atmosphere.
(Much of the motivation comes from coffee and delightful discussions about our cats.)
